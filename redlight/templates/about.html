          <strong>Why does this exist?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the most part, the main REDCap web application is very good. However, doing quick, ad-hoc searches on your database(s) is difficult because there's no real filtering functionality built into the Report section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Red-Light is a simple web application providing a easy way to make one-off searches on your database using any number of filters.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>What does Red-Light do with my API Key?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you press the Search button, Red-Light exports data from your REDCap project two times.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, Red-Light creates a representation of the project in code. It does this using <a href="http://sburns.github.com/PyCap">PyCap</a>, a python library for communicating with REDCap projects. When creating the representation, an API call is issued to grab the REDCap project's metadata, or Data Dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, to fullfill the search request, Red-Light exports only the columns that were specified in the filters and requested output. Absolutely no other data is exported from your project during a search.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the search completes and the results are returned to the webpage, any reference to the PyCap project or the exported data is effectively lost. It is never written to disk or cached.
            </p>
        </li>


        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Does Red-Light store my API Key?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In no way does Red-Light store or attempt to keep your API from one request to the next. HTTP request logs are not written, there is no cookie generated by the website, and the API key will never appear in the URL.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand you have sensitive data in your REDCap database. We do not access your database above and beyond what is needed 1) fullfil the search filters and 2) return outputted data.
